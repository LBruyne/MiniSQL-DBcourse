delete from student;//清空表格  √
delete from student where sname = 'y0' and sgender = 'M'; √//没有任何索引 合取
delete from student where sname = 'y110'; √
delete from student where sname >= 'y108';  √ 按照字典序的大小比较方法：先比长度，再按位比较
delete from student where sname <= 'y2' or sname >= 'y109';  √ //无索引 析取
//无索引的删除

delete from student where sno = 'nber0'; √
delete from student where sno = 'nber70'; √
delete from student where sno = 'nber109'; √
delete from student where sno = 'nber110'; √
delete from student where sno = 'nber0' and sno = 'nber1'; √
delete from student where sno != 'nber0' or sgender <> 'F'; √ 最优的索引上的判定是==

delete from student where sno < 'nber66' and sgender = 'M'; 最优的索引上的判定是<
//<del>出大问题 糙<del>
delete from student where sno >= 'nber105' or sno < 'nber3';
